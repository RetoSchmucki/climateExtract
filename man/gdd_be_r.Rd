\usage{
gdd_be_r(base_temp, min_temp, max_temp, avg_temp, top_temp)
}
\arguments{
\item{base_temp}{value for the base temperature to use for the growing degree day, default = 4Â°C}

\item{min_temp}{raster, rasterbrick or vector of the minimum daily temperature}

\item{max_temp}{raster, rasterbrick or vector of the maximum daily temperature}

\item{avg_temp}{raster, rasterbrick or vector of the mean daily temperature}

\item{top_temp}{value for the maximum temperature beyond growing degree day are not accumulating, default = NULL}
}
\description{
Compute the growing degree day (GDD) using the BE method (Baskerville-Emin method) with base temperature.
}
\details{
This function computes an estimate of GDD fitting a sine curve on the minimum and the maximum to account for
daily variation in temperature.
