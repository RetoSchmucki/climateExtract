\arguments{
\item{first_year}{a numeric value defining the first year of the time period 
to extract, 1950 if NULL, default=NULL}

\item{last_year}{a numeric value defining the last year of the time period to
extract, 2014 if NULL, default=NULL}

\item{local_file}{logical if the ".nc" data are available on your local disc, 
if FALSE, the function will download the data from ECAD data portal,
 default=TRUE}

\item{file_path}{character string with the path to the local ".nc" file. Works
only if local_file = TRUE), default=NULL}

\item{sml_chunk}{a character string for specific time period to be downloaded. 
Chunk available are "2011-2020", "1995-2010", "1980-1994", "1965-1979",
and "1950-1964"}

\item{spatial_extent}{object to define the spatial extent for the data 
extraction, can be an "sf" or an "sp" object or a vector with 4 values 
defining the bounding box c(xmin, ymax, xmax, ymax). If NULL (default), the
 entire extent is extracted}

\item{clim_variable}{a character string defining the daily climate variable to 
retrieve and extract; "mean temp","max temp","min temp","precipitation", 
default="mean temp"}

\item{statistic}{a character string defining the metric to retrieve, "mean" or
 "spread", where the mean is computed across 100 members of the ensemble and 
is provided as the "best-guess" fields. The spread is calculated as the 
difference between the 5th and 95th percentiles over the ensemble to provide
 a measure indicative of the 90\% uncertainty range (see details)}

\item{grid_size}{numeric, measured in degree defining the resolution of the 
grid, 0.25 (ca. 27 kilometres in latitude) or 0.1 (ca. 11 kilometres in 
latitude), default=0.25}

\item{ecad_v}{ECA&D data version, default = package version.}

\item{write_raster}{logical, if TRUE the output will be written in a
multilayer raster file}

\item{out}{character string with the filename for the output raster, if null
data will be written in climateExtract_raster.grd}

\item{return_data}{logical, if TRUE the data resulting from the extract will
be stored in the object, if false, only the filename of the raster and the
name of the layers are returned in a list, only if write_out is TRUE.}

\item{...}{additional arguments for for writing files, see \link[raster]{writeRaster}}
}
\value{
If 'write_raster' is TRUE, return a list with the path to raster 
Brick written to the disk and the name of the layers in the object (date). If
'return_data' = TRUE, a list of object is returned, with the variable_name,
an 3D array with the value extracted, a vector with the longitude, a vector with
latitude and a vector with date extracted.

\description{
Extract climate data from a NETCDF file produced and made available by the 
European Climate Assessment & Dataset for a specific period and 
available at https://surfobs.climate.copernicus.eu/dataaccess/access_eobs.php
}
\details{
By default, this function asks to select the ".nc" file from your
 local disc, but this can be changed by setting the argument 'local_file' to
 FALSE. When local_file is false, the nc file with data will be downloaded
 from the ECAD. If first_year and last_year are not provided, the function
 extract the full data set. Smaller chunks of about 15 years of the most
 recent version of the E-OBS dataset can be specified for download 
can be specified directly with the argument "sm_chunk" (period available are
 2011-2020, 1995-2010, 1980-1994, 1965-1979, 1950-1964). For more details 
about the mean and the spread metric see Cornes et al. (2018) and the 
guidance on how to use ensemble datasets available from
