\arguments{
\item{first_year}{a numeric value defining the first year of the time-period to extract, 1950 if NULL, default=NULL}

\item{last_year}{a numeric value defining the last year of the time-period to extract, 2014 if NULL, default=NULL}

\item{local_file}{logical if the .nc data are available on your local disc, if FALSE the data will be downloaded, default=TRUE}

\item{file_path}{string defining the path of the local file (works only if local_file = TRUE), default=NULL}

\item{sml_chunk}{string defining the time period to be downloaded. Chunk available are "2011-2020", "1995-2010", "1980-1994", "1965-1979", "1950-1964"}

\item{spatial_extent}{spatial extent to extract data, can be an "sf" or an "sp" object or a vector with 4 values defining the bounding box c(xmin, ymax, xmax, ymax), if NULL the entire extent is extracted}

\item{clim_variable}{string defining the daily climate variable of interest; "mean temp","max temp","min temp","precipitation", default="mean temp"}

\item{statistic}{string defining the metric to retrieve, "mean" or "spread", where the mean is computed across the 100 members and is provided as the "best-guess" fields.
The spread is calculated as the difference between the 5th and 95th percentiles over the ensemble to provide a measure indicate of the 90\% uncertainty range. For more details 
see Cornes et al. (2018) and the guidance on how to use ensemble datasets available from http://surfobs.climate.copernicus.eu/userguidance/use_ensembles.php}

\item{grid_size}{numeric value in degree defining the resolution of the grid, 0.25 (ca. 27 kilometres in latitude) or 0.1 (ca. 11 kilometres in latitude), default=0.25}

\item{ecad_v}{ECA&D data version, default = package version.}

\item{write_raster}{logical, if TRUE the output will be written in a multilayer raster file}

\item{out}{character string with the filename for the output raster, if null data will be written in climateExtract_raster.grd}

\item{return_data}{logical, if TRUE the data resulting from the extract will be stored in the object, if false, only the filename of the raster and the name of the layers are returned in a list, only if write_out is TRUE.}

\description{
Function to extract climate data from NETCDF file produced by the European Climate Assessment & Dataset for a specific time-period and available at https://surfobs.climate.copernicus.eu/dataaccess/access_eobs.php
}
\details{
This function ask you to select the .nc file containing the data of interest from your local disc, if local_file is FALSE, data will be downloaded from the ECAD. 
If first_year and last_year are not provided, the function extract the full data set. Smaller chunks of about 15 years of the most recent version of the E-OBS dataset can be specified for download 
can be specified directly with the argument "sm_chunk" (period available are 2011-2020, 1995-2010, 1980-1994, 1965-1979, 1950-1964).
